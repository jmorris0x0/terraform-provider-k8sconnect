Nested Schema for wait_for: Needs love

Delayed plan application: Handle out of date plansI
Autodetect the most recent terraform version for testing locally and in CI. Otherwise this is monthly toil.

Does ignore_fields let you ignore status? Does wait_for allow you to wait_for things that aren't status?

Custom ownership annotations: Solve cross-state conflicts
Status field guardrails: Warn if field doesn't start with "status". Do I have an error? Is it useful?

Terraform wants to be declarative and stateful, Kubernetes wants to be self-healing and continuously reconciling, and developers just want to ship code without becoming infrastructure experts.

Add CI job to check/update cluster scoped resources list?

Test section 15-18 in EDGE_CASES.md for the patch after I dogfood it a bit.

Should the resource datasource and patch be restricted from looking at resources we own? I thought it was already but I guess not. How would this work for plans where the cluster can't be reached? Maybe just warn? Do I already do this?

Answer: We are definitely restricting patching our own resources but currently allowing reads. (pretty sure)

Can you wait for stuff that isn't status? Is wait_for really sold in the registry docs? We kinda forgot about it for a minute.

Mention that that two kinds of patches aren't SSA therefore UX difference.

Should I make field_ownership sensitive? It's very noisy during destroy.

Last minute decision: Should I change the name of managed_state_projection?

Create a little FAQ for things like, why have a separate wait resource? There are probably other decisons in the ADRs that people might be curious about.

Update comparison table in README.

add ", helper datasource" to CRD row in readme.

wait_for row is out of date. Need to update to wait resource. Add to FAQ: Why is wait a resource instead of a datasource? Why separate resrouce.

Put a local between the cluster and the resource in the first example in the readme. It would make the object cleaner.

dd
Should i call it wait_status? Or status_wait? wait just seems like a time wait.

Alert emoji with errors? Might look nice. 

ignore_changes part of terraform core?

object_ref inconsistency? What did I decide about this?
