Splits multi-document YAML content into categorized manifests for dependency ordering. Resources are grouped by scope: CRDs first, then cluster-scoped resources (Namespaces, ClusterRoles), then namespaced resources (Deployments, Services, etc.).

## Schema

### Optional

- `content` (String) Raw YAML content containing one or more Kubernetes manifests separated by '---'. Mutually exclusive with 'pattern'.
- `pattern` (String) Glob pattern to match YAML files (e.g., './manifests/*.yaml', './configs/**/*.yml'). Supports recursive patterns. Mutually exclusive with 'content'.

### Read-Only

- `cluster_scoped` (Map of String) Map of cluster-scoped resource manifests (Namespaces, ClusterRoles, PersistentVolumes, etc). Apply these second after CRDs.
- `crds` (Map of String) Map of CustomResourceDefinition manifests. Apply these first with depends_on to ensure CRDs exist before custom resources.
- `id` (String) Data source identifier based on input content hash.
- `namespaced` (Map of String) Map of namespaced resource manifests (Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, etc). Apply these last after cluster-scoped resources.
