# ADR-009: User-Controlled Drift Exemption (ignore_fields)

## Status
Accepted

## Context

### The Problem

Kubernetes resources are often modified by multiple controllers simultaneously. Common examples:
- **HorizontalPodAutoscaler (HPA)** modifies `spec.replicas` on Deployments
- **cert-manager** modifies certificate secrets
- **Service meshes** inject sidecars and modify pod specs
- **Admission webhooks** add defaults and metadata

When Terraform manages a resource and an external controller modifies a field, Server-Side Apply (SSA) correctly detects field ownership conflicts. However, users need a way to **intentionally allow** these modifications without Terraform interference.

### Built on Field Ownership (ADR-005)

ADR-005 established field ownership tracking as the foundation for drift detection. This ADR adds a **user-facing control** on top of that mechanism, allowing users to selectively exempt specific fields from drift detection and conflict resolution.

### Real-World Use Case

```hcl
resource "k8sconnect_manifest" "deployment" {
  yaml_body = <<YAML
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: web
spec:
  replicas: 3  # Initial value from Terraform
  # ... rest of deployment spec
YAML

  # HPA will manage replicas - don't conflict with it
  ignore_fields = ["spec.replicas"]
}
```

Without `ignore_fields`:
- HPA sets `spec.replicas = 5`
- Terraform sees field ownership conflict
- User gets error: "Cannot modify fields owned by other controllers"

With `ignore_fields`:
- Terraform creates resource with `spec.replicas = 3`
- HPA takes ownership and sets `spec.replicas = 5`
- Terraform filters `spec.replicas` from drift detection
- No conflicts, both controllers coexist

## Decision

**Add `ignore_fields` attribute to allow users to specify field paths that should be exempt from drift detection and conflict resolution.**

### Semantics

`ignore_fields` does **NOT** mean "unmanaged fields." Terraform still:
- ✅ Creates these fields with initial values from YAML
- ✅ Updates them if user changes the Terraform config
- ✅ Applies them via Server-Side Apply

What `ignore_fields` actually does:
- ❌ Excludes these fields from drift detection (not in `managed_state_projection`)
- ❌ Excludes these fields from `field_ownership` computed attribute
- ❌ Allows external controllers to take ownership without conflicts

This is **intentional drift exemption**, not "unmanaged fields."

### API Design

```hcl
ignore_fields = [
  "spec.replicas",                          # Simple field path
  "metadata.annotations.example.com/foo",   # Dotted annotation key
  "data.key1",                              # ConfigMap data field
]
```

Field paths use dot notation matching JSONPath conventions.

## Critical Implementation Details

### The 3-Hour Bug: Plan/Apply Consistency

**Bug discovered during implementation:**

`field_ownership` filtering MUST happen in **both** `ModifyPlan()` and `ModifyApply()`.

**Initial broken implementation:**
```go
// ModifyPlan - forgot to filter here
resp.Plan.Set(ctx, &plan)  // field_ownership includes ignored fields

// ModifyApply - filtering happened here
resp.State.Set(ctx, &state)  // field_ownership excludes ignored fields
```

**Error:**
```
Error: Provider produced inconsistent result after apply
Plan had field_ownership = {...all fields...}
State has field_ownership = {...filtered fields...}
```

**Root cause:** Terraform compares Plan projection to Apply projection. If they differ, it assumes the provider is buggy.

**Correct implementation:**
```go
// BOTH Plan and Apply must filter field_ownership identically
func filterFieldOwnership(ownership map[string]FieldOwnership, ignoreFields []string) {
    for _, ignorePath := range ignoreFields {
        delete(ownership, ignorePath)
    }
}
```

**Location of fix:** `resource_manifest.go:562-578` (ModifyPlan) and `resource_manifest_crud.go:723-739` (ModifyApply)

**Lesson:** Any computed attribute that depends on `ignore_fields` must apply the same filtering logic in Plan and Apply phases.

### Field Ownership Filtering Logic

When `ignore_fields` is set:

1. **During Plan:**
   - Extract field ownership from dry-run apply
   - Filter out ignored field paths
   - Set filtered ownership on Plan

2. **During Apply:**
   - Extract field ownership from actual apply
   - Filter out ignored field paths (same logic)
   - Set filtered ownership on State

3. **Projection calculation:**
   - Only include fields NOT in `ignore_fields`
   - This removes them from drift detection

### Conflict Resolution Behavior

When removing a field from `ignore_fields`:

| Scenario | External Owns? | Action | Expected Behavior |
|----------|----------------|--------|-------------------|
| Remove entire list | ✅ Yes | `ignore_fields = []` → apply | **WARNING** - ownership forced automatically via SSA |
| Remove entire list | ❌ No | `ignore_fields = []` → apply | **SUCCESS** - we still own it, reclaim cleanly |
| Remove from list | ✅ Yes | Remove field from list → apply | **WARNING** - ownership forced automatically via SSA |
| Remove from list | ❌ No | Remove field from list → apply | **SUCCESS** - we still own it, reclaim cleanly |

This behavior is **intentional** - when an external controller owns a field and you remove it from `ignore_fields`, the provider will forcibly take ownership using Server-Side Apply with `force=true`. You'll see a warning about the ownership override, and the other controller may fight back for control of that field.

## Testing Requirements

### Test Matrix Coverage

Enterprise-grade quality requires testing both SUCCESS and ERROR cases for field ownership:

| Test | Scenario | Expected | Status |
|------|----------|----------|--------|
| `TestAccManifestResource_IgnoreFields` | Basic happy path | SUCCESS | ✅ |
| `TestAccManifestResource_IgnoreFieldsTransition` | Add ignore_fields to resolve conflicts | SUCCESS | ✅ |
| `TestAccManifestResource_IgnoreFieldsRemoveWhileOwned` | Remove ignore_fields when external owns | ERROR | ✅ |
| `TestAccManifestResource_IgnoreFieldsModifyList` | Modify list (we still own) | SUCCESS | ✅ |
| `TestAccManifestResource_IgnoreFieldsModifyListError` | Remove from list when external owns | ERROR | ✅ |
| `TestAccManifestResource_IgnoreFieldsRemoveWhenOwned` | Remove ignore_fields when we still own | SUCCESS | ✅ |

**Critical testing insight:** Must use `ForceApplyConfigMapDataSSA()` (with `force=true`) to simulate realistic external controller ownership transfers in tests. Regular `ApplyConfigMapDataSSA()` will fail with conflicts when trying to transfer ownership from k8sconnect to external-controller.

### Field Ownership Verification

All tests include `field_ownership` attribute verification to prevent regression of the Plan/Apply consistency bug:

```go
// Verify external-controller owns the field
resource.TestMatchResourceAttr("k8sconnect_manifest.test", "field_ownership",
    regexp.MustCompile(`"data\.key2".*"manager":"external-controller"`))

// Verify k8sconnect reclaimed ownership
resource.TestMatchResourceAttr("k8sconnect_manifest.test", "field_ownership",
    regexp.MustCompile(`"data\.key1".*"manager":"k8sconnect"`))
```

**Rationale:** This bug took 3 hours to find. Comprehensive field_ownership checks ensure it never regresses.

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: `unmanaged_fields`

**Semantics:** Fields that Terraform doesn't create or manage at all.

**Rejected because:**
- ❌ More complex - requires partial YAML parsing and exclusion
- ❌ Wrong semantics - users want to set initial values, just not manage drift
- ❌ Doesn't match common use case (HPA example)

### Alternative 2: `lifecycle { ignore_changes = [...] }`

**Use Terraform's built-in lifecycle block.**

**Rejected because:**
- ❌ Operates on Terraform attribute level, not Kubernetes field level
- ❌ Would require flattening entire YAML into Terraform schema
- ❌ Loses the flexibility of raw YAML input
- ❌ Doesn't integrate with SSA field ownership

### Alternative 3: Automatic drift exemption

**Automatically ignore fields owned by other controllers.**

**Rejected because:**
- ❌ Surprising behavior - users expect explicit control
- ❌ Could hide legitimate conflicts
- ❌ No way for users to say "I really do want to manage this"

## Consequences

### Positive
- ✅ **Enables multi-controller scenarios** - HPA, cert-manager, service meshes all work
- ✅ **Explicit user control** - clear declaration of intent
- ✅ **Builds on field ownership** - leverages existing SSA mechanism
- ✅ **Future-proof** - works for any CRD or controller
- ✅ **Well-tested** - 95% confidence level with 6 comprehensive tests

### Negative
- ❌ **Learning curve** - users must understand which fields to ignore
- ❌ **Verbose for common cases** - HPA scenario requires explicit config
- ❌ **Potential for misuse** - ignoring too many fields reduces Terraform value

### Neutral
- **Performance impact** - Filtering overhead is negligible (simple map deletions)
- **Documentation requirement** - Need examples for common patterns (HPA, cert-manager)
