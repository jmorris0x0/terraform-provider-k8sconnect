# ADR-019: Force=True Ownership Prediction

**Status:** Proposed
**Date:** 2025-10-24
**Related ADRs:** ADR-005 (Field Ownership Strategy), ADR-001 (Managed State Projection)
**Investigation:** [FIELD_OWNERSHIP_PREDICTION_BUG.md](../design/FIELD_OWNERSHIP_PREDICTION_BUG.md), [INVESTIGATION_LOG.md](../design/INVESTIGATION_LOG.md), [EVIDENCE_COMPLETE.md](../design/EVIDENCE_COMPLETE.md)

## Context

### The Field Ownership Prediction System

ADR-005 established that we use Server-Side Apply (SSA) dry-run to predict field ownership during the plan phase:

1. **Plan phase**: Dry-run with `force=true` → extract managedFields → show predicted ownership
2. **Apply phase**: Actual SSA apply with `force=true` → extract managedFields → show actual ownership
3. **User value**: Users see ownership transitions in plan diffs (e.g., `"kubectl-patch" -> "k8sconnect"`)

This system took hundreds of hours to build and is a core differentiator of this provider.

### The Discovery

After extensive debugging of a flaky test (`TestAccObjectResource_IgnoreFieldsJSONPathPredicate` failing ~20% of time), we discovered a fundamental limitation:

**Kubernetes dry-run with `force=true` does NOT predict ownership takeover in managedFields.**

### What We Found (Irrefutable Evidence)

**Success case** (80% of time):
```
Dry-run predicts: env[1].name owned by "k8sconnect"
Actual apply:     env[1].name owned by "k8sconnect"
✅ MATCH → test passes
```

**Failure case** (20% of time):
```
Dry-run predicts: env[1].name owned by "kubectl-patch"
Actual apply:     env[1].name owned by "k8sconnect"
❌ MISMATCH → Terraform error: "Provider produced inconsistent result"
```

See [EVIDENCE_COMPLETE.md](../design/EVIDENCE_COMPLETE.md) for captured data proving this with actual test runs.

### Root Cause: Timing-Dependent Behavior

The 20% failure rate is explained by timing:

1. **Kubernetes returns managedFields sorted** by `(timestamp ASC, manager name ASC)`
2. **Dry-run uses current wall-clock time** for simulated k8sconnect operations
3. **kubectl-patch timestamp is frozen** at when it actually ran

**When timestamps differ** (different seconds):
```
managedFields: [kubectl-patch (T), k8sconnect (T+1)]
We iterate, last wins → k8sconnect predicted ✅
Actual apply with force=true → k8sconnect owns ✅
MATCH → test passes
```

**When timestamps equal** (same second):
```
managedFields: [k8sconnect (T), kubectl-patch (T)]  ← alphabetical order
We iterate, last wins → kubectl-patch predicted ❌
Actual apply with force=true → k8sconnect owns ✅
MISMATCH → test fails
```

### Why Kubernetes Works This Way

From Kubernetes API server's perspective:

**Dry-run is designed for:**
- ✅ Validation (will this succeed or conflict?)
- ✅ Schema checking (are the fields valid?)
- ✅ Preview of resource spec/status changes

**Dry-run is NOT designed for:**
- ❌ Simulating all side effects
- ❌ Computing exact managedFields ownership changes
- ❌ Running the full SSA merge algorithm twice

**Why:** Performance and scope. Computing SSA ownership is expensive, and managedFields are metadata, not the resource itself. Dry-run validates the operation, doesn't fully simulate it.

**This is a design limitation, not a bug in Kubernetes.**

### Source Code Evidence

Analysis of Kubernetes API server source code confirms this design:

**From `staging/src/k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/endpoints/handlers/patch.go`:**
> "The code shows **no differentiation** in patch application logic between dry-run and actual applies. The distinction is enforced at the admission layer and storage layer, not within the patch mechanics themselves."

**From `staging/src/k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/endpoints/handlers/update.go`:**
> "The provided code contains no explicit handling for force=true during dry-run operations. The dry-run flag is passed to admission controllers but **doesn't change how managedFields are computed**."

**Key finding:** Kubernetes executes the same field manager update logic for both dry-run and actual apply. The `force=true` parameter is passed to the field manager, but dry-run stops before actually applying ownership changes. This means:

1. Dry-run computes managedFields based on **current state**
2. Dry-run doesn't simulate the **post-force ownership state**
3. The force=true ownership takeover only happens during actual apply when changes are persisted

This is architectural: dry-run is designed to validate "will this work?" not "what exactly will the metadata look like after?"

## The Architectural Problem

Our current implementation in ADR-005:

```go
// plan_modifier.go:267
predictedOwnership := parseFieldsV1ToPathMap(dryRunResult.GetManagedFields(), desiredObj.Object)
ownershipMap := make(map[string]string)
for path, ownership := range predictedOwnership {
    ownershipMap[path] = ownership.Manager  // ← Trusts dry-run result
}
```

**Assumption (WRONG):** "Dry-run with force=true shows what managedFields will look like after apply"

**Reality:** Dry-run shows current ownership, not post-force=true ownership.

### Why This Matters

**User impact:**
- Import workflows fail intermittently
- Drift correction fails intermittently
- Multi-tool management (HPA + Terraform) fails intermittently
- Error message blames the provider: "This is a bug in the provider"

**Our responsibility:**
- We use `force=true` → We WILL take ownership
- We must predict this correctly
- Can't rely on dry-run's managedFields alone

## Decision

**We will explicitly recognize force=true semantics when predicting field ownership.**

When we apply a field with SSA `force=true`, we WILL own that field after apply, regardless of what dry-run's managedFields iteration suggests.

### Implementation Strategy

**Option A: Override Prediction (Preferred)**

After dry-run, for fields we're applying:

```go
// Get predicted ownership from dry-run (shows current state)
predictedOwnership := parseFieldsV1ToPathMap(dryRunResult.GetManagedFields(), desiredObj.Object)

// Convert to ownership map
ownershipMap := make(map[string]string)
for path, ownership := range predictedOwnership {
    ownershipMap[path] = ownership.Manager
}

// NEW: Override for fields we're applying with force=true
// These fields WILL be owned by k8sconnect after apply
fieldsWeAreApplying := extractAllFieldsFromYAML(objToApply.Object, "")
for _, path := range fieldsWeAreApplying {
    // If this field exists in the resource (dry-run knows about it)
    // AND we're sending it in our apply
    // THEN we will own it (force=true guarantees this)
    if _, exists := ownershipMap[path]; exists {
        ownershipMap[path] = "k8sconnect"
    }
}
```

**Why this works:**
- SSA with force=true GUARANTEES we take ownership of fields we send
- We know exactly which fields we're sending (objToApply)
- We know ignore_fields are filtered out
- Simple overlay: dry-run shows current, we override with predicted

### What About Visibility?

**Concern:** Does this destroy ownership transition visibility?

**Answer:** NO - this is different from the failed fix (commit eb56686).

**Failed approach** (commit eb56686):
- Overwrote current ownership immediately
- State already had "k8sconnect"
- Plan showed: `"k8sconnect" -> "k8sconnect"` (no transition visible)

**This approach:**
- Dry-run still shows current reality: `"kubectl-patch"`
- We override ONLY the prediction for plan
- Plan shows: `"kubectl-patch" -> "k8sconnect"` ✅
- Apply results in: `"k8sconnect"` ✅
- Terraform: MATCH ✅

**The key difference:** We're predicting the POST-APPLY state correctly, not hiding current state.

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Retry Pattern

Wait for managedFields propagation, retry if mismatch detected.

**Pros:**
- Doesn't change prediction logic
- Self-healing

**Cons:**
- Adds 150ms delay in 20% of cases
- Doesn't fix root cause (prediction still wrong in plan)
- More complex implementation
- Doesn't help with plan visibility

**Status:** Rejected - treats symptom, not cause

### Alternative 2: Normalize managedFields Ordering

Sort managedFields deterministically before processing.

**Pros:**
- Makes behavior consistent

**Cons:**
- Makes it CONSISTENTLY WRONG
- Tests prove this: forces wrong order 100% of time
- Doesn't solve the underlying issue

**Status:** Rejected - makes problem worse

### Alternative 3: Two Separate Attributes

```hcl
field_ownership_current = {
  "spec.replicas" = "kubectl-patch"
}
field_ownership_predicted = {
  "spec.replicas" = "k8sconnect"
}
```

**Pros:**
- Shows both current and future state
- Avoids inconsistency

**Cons:**
- Breaking schema change
- More complex UX
- Unclear which to use in downstream resources
- Unnecessary complexity

**Status:** Rejected - unnecessary breaking change

### Alternative 4: Accept as Known Limitation

Document this as a Kubernetes API limitation, tell users to apply twice.

**Pros:**
- No code changes

**Cons:**
- Terrible UX
- Users must run apply twice
- Import workflows broken
- Looks like a buggy provider

**Status:** Rejected - unacceptable user experience

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Fixes flaky test** - 100% pass rate instead of 80%
2. **Fixes import workflows** - no more inconsistency errors on first apply
3. **Fixes drift correction** - reliable ownership reclaim
4. **Preserves visibility** - users still see ownership transitions
5. **No breaking changes** - schema unchanged, behavior improved
6. **Minimal code change** - simple override logic in plan_modifier.go

### Negative

1. **Architectural shift** - no longer fully trusting dry-run for ownership
2. **Adds explicit handling** - force=true semantics must be manually recognized
3. **Maintenance burden** - must keep this logic in sync with SSA behavior

### Neutral

1. **Documents Kubernetes limitation** - this is a known API design choice
2. **May affect other providers** - anyone predicting SSA ownership faces this

## Implementation Notes

### Location

File: `internal/k8sconnect/resource/object/plan_modifier.go`
Function: `calculateProjection()` around line 267

### Key Points

1. **Only override fields we're applying** - don't touch ignored fields
2. **Only override if field exists** - don't add non-existent fields
3. **Respect ignore_fields** - filtered fields stay as-is
4. **Log for visibility** - add debug logging showing override

### Testing

1. **Flaky test must pass 100%** - `TestAccObjectResource_IgnoreFieldsJSONPathPredicate`
2. **Import workflows must work** - no inconsistency on first apply
3. **Drift correction must work** - reliable ownership reclaim
4. **Visibility must be preserved** - transitions visible in plan diffs

**Note on managedFields Sorting:**
The exact sorting implementation in Kubernetes source code was not located during investigation. However:
- Issue #88031 confirms sorting exists and mentions it happens "in a second place" at `capmanagers.go` lines 80-91
- Empirical evidence from 100+ test observations consistently shows sorting by `(timestamp ASC, manager name ASC, operation ASC)`
- The behavior is reproducible and deterministic given the same timestamps
- This is consistent with general SSA design principles (track by manager, time, and operation)
