# ADR-007: Automatic CRD Dependency Resolution Without Configuration

## Status
Implemented (2025-10-06)

## Context

### The Problem

When applying Terraform configurations that contain both Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) and Custom Resources (CRs) that use those CRDs, a race condition occurs. Even with `depends_on`, the CRD may not be fully established when the CR is applied, causing failures due to Kubernetes' eventual consistency model.

This forces users into awkward workarounds:
```bash
# Current workaround required by other providers:
terraform apply -target=module.crds  # First, apply CRDs
terraform apply                       # Then, apply everything else
```

### The Four Scenarios We Must Handle

1. **CRD Already Exists** → Works fine (happy path)
2. **CRD Doesn't Exist (and won't be added)** → Should fail with clear error
3. **CRD Will Be Created in Same Apply** → **This is the key case to solve**
4. **CRD Exists but Will Be Destroyed** → User error, should fail appropriately

### Industry Context

This has been an unsolved problem for 3+ years:

**HashiCorp Kubernetes Provider:**
- Issue #1367 (Aug 2021): 362+ 👍 reactions
- Issue #2597 (Oct 2024): Still requesting fix
- Requires two-phase deployment or separate modules
- No retry mechanism

**Kubectl Provider (Gavin Bunney):**
- Has `apply_retry_count` parameter
- Still often needs two applies
- Requires user configuration

**Common Workarounds Users Resort To:**
```hcl
# Time delays (unreliable)
resource "time_sleep" "wait_for_crd" {
  depends_on = [kubernetes_manifest.crd]
  create_duration = "30s"
}

# Local exec (breaks pure Terraform)
provisioner "local-exec" {
  command = "kubectl wait --for condition=established --timeout=60s crd/${var.crd_name}"
}
```

## Decision

**We will implement automatic apply-time intelligent waiting with zero configuration required.**

When a "no matches for kind" error occurs during apply:
1. Automatically retry with exponential backoff
2. Wait up to 30 seconds for CRD establishment
3. Succeed if CRD becomes available
4. Fail with actionable error if CRD truly missing

## Rationale

### Design Principles

1. **It Must Just Work™** - Single `terraform apply` succeeds without user intervention
2. **Zero Configuration** - No retry counts, wait times, or flags to tune
3. **Fast Happy Path** - Near-zero overhead when CRDs already exist
4. **Clear Failure Modes** - When it fails, users know exactly why

### Why Apply-Time Only (Initially)

We explicitly choose NOT to modify plan-time behavior initially because:
- Plan-time validation catches real configuration errors
- Suppressing plan errors reduces safety
- Apply-time retry is sufficient to solve the problem
- Can enhance plan behavior later if needed

## Considered Alternatives

### Option A: Configuration-Based Retry (kubectl provider approach)
```hcl
provider "k8sconnect" {
  apply_retry_count = 15
}
```
**Rejected:** Requires user configuration, violates zero-config principle

### Option B: Time-Based Delays
```hcl
resource "time_sleep" "wait" {
  depends_on = [k8sconnect_manifest.crd]
  create_duration = "30s"
}
```
**Rejected:** Unreliable, wastes time, poor user experience

### Option C: Skip Plan-Time Validation
Don't perform dry-run if CRD is missing.

**Rejected:** Loses valuable early error detection for genuine mistakes

### Option D: Two-Phase Module Structure
Require users to separate CRDs and CRs into different modules.

**Rejected:** Poor developer experience, doesn't "just work"

### Option E: External Dependency Detection
Analyze the plan graph to detect CRD dependencies automatically.

**Rejected:** May not have access to full plan graph, overly complex

### Option F: User-Configured Validation Mode
```hcl
provider "k8sconnect" {
  crd_validation = "strict" | "lenient"
}
```
**Rejected:** Configuration option violates zero-config principle

## Implementation

### Retry Strategy

```go
func applyWithCRDRetry(ctx context.Context, obj *unstructured.Unstructured) error {
    backoff := []time.Duration{
        100 * time.Millisecond,  // Nearly instant first retry
        500 * time.Millisecond,  
        1 * time.Second,
        2 * time.Second,
        5 * time.Second,
        10 * time.Second,
        10 * time.Second,  // Total: ~30 seconds
    }
    
    var lastErr error
    for attempt, delay := range backoff {
        err := client.Apply(ctx, obj)
        
        if err == nil {
            return nil // Success!
        }
        
        if !isCRDMissingError(err) {
            return err // Different error, fail immediately
        }
        
        lastErr = err
        
        // Check if resource has depends_on - if not, fail fast after 5s
        if !hasDependsOn(obj) && attempt > 3 {
            break
        }
        
        tflog.Debug(ctx, "CRD not ready, retrying", map[string]interface{}{
            "attempt": attempt + 1,
            "delay":   delay,
            "kind":    obj.GetKind(),
        })
        
        select {
        case <-time.After(delay):
            continue
        case <-ctx.Done():
            return ctx.Err()
        }
    }
    
    // Enhanced error message after all retries exhausted
    return fmt.Errorf(
        "CRD for %s/%s not found after 30s.\n\n" +
        "This usually means one of:\n" +
        "1. The CRD doesn't exist and won't be created\n" +
        "2. The CRD is being created but needs more time to establish\n" +
        "3. There's a typo in the apiVersion or kind\n\n" +
        "Solutions:\n" +
        "- Ensure CRD resource has depends_on relationship\n" +
        "- Verify the CRD name matches the CR's apiVersion\n" +
        "- Apply CRDs first: terraform apply -target=<crd_resource>\n",
        obj.GetKind(), obj.GetName(),
    )
}
```

### Detection Logic

```go
func isCRDMissingError(err error) bool {
    if statusErr, ok := err.(*errors.StatusError); ok {
        message := strings.ToLower(statusErr.ErrStatus.Message)
        return strings.Contains(message, "no matches for kind") ||
               strings.Contains(message, "could not find the requested resource")
    }
    return false
}
```

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Single apply works** - CRD and CR can be deployed together
- **Zero configuration** - No settings, flags, or retry counts
- **Better than competition** - Solves what others haven't in 3+ years
- **Fast when unnecessary** - <100ms overhead if CRD exists
- **Clear errors** - Actionable guidance when genuinely broken

### Negative
- **30-second worst case** - May wait up to 30s for truly missing CRDs
- **Apply-time discovery** - Problems not caught during plan
- **Retry overhead** - Additional API calls during failure cases

### Neutral
- **Plan still fails** - Keeps early validation (can enhance later)
- **Logs during retry** - Users see retry attempts in debug logs

## Success Metrics

- CRD + CR in same apply succeeds without configuration
- Less than 200ms overhead when CRDs exist
- Clear error messages when CRDs genuinely missing
- All existing tests continue passing
- New tests cover all four scenarios

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2: Smarter Plan-Time Behavior
- Track CRDs being created in current plan
- Mark CR validations as "deferred" when depending on same-plan CRDs
- Show warning instead of error during plan

### Phase 3: CRD Establishment Verification
- After CRD apply, verify it's established before proceeding
- Use Kubernetes wait conditions API
- Prevent race conditions more definitively

## Migration

No migration needed - this is purely additive functionality that makes existing configurations work better.

## Decision

We commit to implementing automatic apply-time CRD waiting with zero configuration. This solves a critical pain point that has plagued the Kubernetes Terraform ecosystem for over 3 years, and does so in a way that "just works" without any user configuration.

The implementation complexity is modest (1-2 days) while the user experience improvement is substantial. This positions k8sconnect as the first Kubernetes provider to properly solve the CRD race condition problem.

## Implementation Notes

Implemented on 2025-10-06 with the following components:

### Files Modified
- `internal/k8sconnect/resource/manifest/errors.go`: Added `isCRDNotFoundError()` detection and enhanced error classification
- `internal/k8sconnect/resource/manifest/crud_common.go`: Implemented `applyWithCRDRetry()` with exponential backoff and integrated into apply path
- `internal/k8sconnect/resource/manifest/crd_test.go`: Added acceptance test proving CRD + CR work in single apply

### Actual Implementation
The retry logic follows the proposed design with these specifics:
- Backoff schedule: 100ms → 500ms → 1s → 2s → 5s → 10s → 10s (~30s total)
- Respects context cancellation for graceful shutdown
- Logs retry attempts at debug level for troubleshooting
- Only retries "no matches for kind" errors, fails fast on other errors
- Provides enhanced error messages with actionable solutions after timeout

### Test Results
- `TestAccManifestResource_CRDAndCRTogether` passes in ~24s
- Proves CRD establishment, CR creation, and cleanup all work in single apply
- No configuration required - zero-config principle maintained

### Deviations from Proposal
The implemented version simplified the `hasDependsOn()` fast-fail logic shown in the pseudocode, instead relying on the full 30s timeout for all cases. This keeps the implementation simpler while still solving the problem effectively.
