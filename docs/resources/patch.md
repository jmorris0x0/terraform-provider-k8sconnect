# k8sconnect_patch (Resource)

Applies targeted patches to existing Kubernetes resources using Server-Side Apply.

⚠️ **CRITICAL: This resource forcefully takes ownership of fields from other controllers**

**ONLY use k8sconnect_patch for:**
- ✅ Cloud provider defaults (AWS EKS, GCP GKE, Azure AKS system resources)
- ✅ Operator-managed resources (cert-manager, nginx-ingress, etc.)
- ✅ Helm chart deployments
- ✅ Resources created by other tools

**NEVER use k8sconnect_patch for:**
- ❌ Resources managed by k8sconnect_manifest in the same state
- ❌ Resources you want full lifecycle control over
- ❌ Resources where you could use k8sconnect_manifest instead

**Destroy behavior:**
When you `terraform destroy` a patch:
- ✅ Ownership is released
- ✅ Patched values REMAIN on the resource
- ❌ Values are NOT reverted to original state

## Schema

### Required

- `cluster_connection` (Attributes) Kubernetes cluster connection for this specific patch. Can be different per-resource, enabling multi-cluster deployments without provider aliases. Supports inline credentials (token, exec, client certs) or kubeconfig. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--cluster_connection))
- `take_ownership` (Boolean) **Required acknowledgment.** Must be set to `true` to confirm you understand this patch will forcefully take field ownership from other controllers. This is not optional - it's a required safety acknowledgment. External controllers may fight back for control of these fields.
- `target` (Attributes) Identifies the Kubernetes resource to patch. The resource must already exist. Changes to target require replacement. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--target))

### Optional

- `json_patch` (String) JSON Patch (RFC 6902) operations as JSON array. Use for precise operations like adding/removing specific array elements. Example: `[{"op":"add","path":"/metadata/labels/foo","value":"bar"}]`
- `merge_patch` (String) JSON Merge Patch (RFC 7386) content. Simple key-value merges, replaces entire arrays. Least powerful but simplest patch type.
- `patch` (String) Strategic merge patch content (YAML or JSON). This is the recommended patch type for most use cases. Uses Kubernetes strategic merge semantics with merge keys for arrays.
- `wait_for` (Attributes) Wait for resource to reach desired state after patching. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--wait_for))

### Read-Only

- `field_ownership` (Map of String) Map of field paths to their current owner (field manager). Shows which controller owns each patched field. After patch application, patched fields should show this patch's field manager as owner.
- `id` (String) Unique identifier for this patch (generated by the provider).
- `managed_fields` (String) JSON representation of only the fields managed by this patch. Used for drift detection.
- `previous_owners` (Map of String) Map of field paths to their owners BEFORE this patch was applied. Useful for understanding which controllers were managing fields before takeover. Only populated during initial patch creation.

### Nested Schema for `cluster_connection`

Optional:

- `client_certificate` (String, Sensitive) Client certificate for TLS authentication. Accepts PEM format or base64-encoded PEM - automatically detected.
- `client_key` (String, Sensitive) Client certificate key for TLS authentication. Accepts PEM format or base64-encoded PEM - automatically detected.
- `cluster_ca_certificate` (String, Sensitive) Root certificate bundle for TLS authentication. Accepts PEM format or base64-encoded PEM - automatically detected.
- `context` (String) Context to use from the kubeconfig. Optional when kubeconfig contains exactly one context (that context will be used automatically). Required when kubeconfig contains multiple contexts to prevent accidental connection to the wrong cluster. Error will list available contexts if not specified when required.
- `exec` (Attributes) Configuration for exec-based authentication. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--cluster_connection--exec))
- `host` (String) The hostname (in form of URI) of the Kubernetes API server.
- `insecure` (Boolean) Whether server should be accessed without verifying the TLS certificate.
- `kubeconfig` (String, Sensitive) Raw kubeconfig file content.
- `proxy_url` (String) URL of the proxy to use for requests.
- `token` (String, Sensitive) Token to authenticate to the Kubernetes API server.

<a id="nestedatt--cluster_connection--exec"></a>
### Nested Schema for `cluster_connection.exec`

Required:

- `api_version` (String) API version to use when encoding the ExecCredentials resource.
- `command` (String) Command to execute.

Optional:

- `args` (List of String) Arguments to pass when executing the plugin.
- `env` (Map of String) Environment variables to set when executing the plugin.



<a id="nestedatt--target"></a>
### Nested Schema for `target`

Required:

- `api_version` (String) API version of the target resource (e.g., 'apps/v1', 'v1'). Changes require replacement.
- `kind` (String) Kind of the target resource (e.g., 'DaemonSet', 'Deployment'). Changes require replacement.
- `name` (String) Name of the target resource. Changes require replacement.

Optional:

- `namespace` (String) Namespace of the target resource. Omit for cluster-scoped resources. Changes require replacement.


<a id="nestedatt--wait_for"></a>
### Nested Schema for `wait_for`

Optional:

- `condition` (String) Condition type that must be True after patching. Example: 'Ready'
- `field` (String) JSONPath to field that must exist/be non-empty after patching. Example: 'status.conditions'
- `field_value` (Map of String) Map of JSONPath to expected value. Example: {'status.phase': 'Running'}
- `rollout` (Boolean) Wait for Deployment/StatefulSet/DaemonSet rollout to complete after patching. Checks that all replicas are updated and available.
- `timeout` (String) Maximum time to wait. Defaults to 10m. Format: '30s', '5m', '1h'
