# Resource: k8sconnect_wait

Waits for a Kubernetes resource to reach a desired state. Use this resource to wait for resources created by k8sconnect_object without risking resource tainting on timeout. Follows the pattern: create resource -> wait for readiness -> use outputs.

The `k8sconnect_wait` resource waits for Kubernetes resources to reach a desired state. It references a `k8sconnect_object` resource via `object_ref` and blocks until the specified wait condition is met.

## Wait Strategies

Choose the right wait strategy based on your use case:

### Field Wait (`field`)
**Use for**: Infrastructure resources that need status values for DNS, outputs, or resource chaining
- LoadBalancer Services, Ingress, cert-manager Certificates, Crossplane resources, Custom CRDs
- **Populates `.result` attribute** for use in other resources
- Only the waited-for field is extracted to prevent drift from volatile fields

### Rollout Wait (`rollout`)
**Use for**: Workloads that need complete deployment confirmation
- Deployments, StatefulSets, DaemonSets
- **Does NOT populate `.result`** - use `depends_on` for sequencing
- Checks replicas, updatedReplicas, readyReplicas, and observedGeneration

### Condition Wait (`condition`)
**Use for**: Resources with Kubernetes conditions (Ready, Available, etc.)
- Deployments (Available, Progressing), Custom CRDs with conditions
- **Does NOT populate `.result`** - use `depends_on` for sequencing
- Waits for condition status to be "True"

### Field Value Wait (`field_value`)
**Use for**: Waiting for specific field values (Job completion, PVC binding, etc.)
- Jobs (status.succeeded), PVCs (status.phase)
- **Does NOT populate `.result`** - use `depends_on` for sequencing
- Checks exact string match for field values

## Example Usage - Wait for LoadBalancer (field wait)

Wait for a LoadBalancer to be provisioned and use its IP in other resources.

<!-- runnable-test: wait-loadbalancer -->
```terraform
resource "k8sconnect_object" "service" {
  yaml_body = <<-YAML
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      name: demo-lb
      namespace: example
    spec:
      type: LoadBalancer
      ports:
      - port: 80
        targetPort: 8080
      selector:
        app: demo
  YAML

  cluster_connection = local.cluster_connection
}

resource "k8sconnect_wait" "service" {
  object_ref = k8sconnect_object.service.object_ref

  wait_for = {
    field   = "status.loadBalancer.ingress"
    timeout = "5m"
  }

  cluster_connection = local.cluster_connection
}

# Use the LoadBalancer IP in another resource
resource "k8sconnect_object" "endpoint_config" {

## Example Usage - Wait for External Resources (standalone)

Use `k8sconnect_wait` to wait for resources you **don't manage with Terraform** - no `k8sconnect_object` needed.

<!-- runnable-test: wait-external-resources -->
```terraform
# Wait for metrics-server (installed via Helm, kubeadm, etc.)
resource "k8sconnect_wait" "metrics_server" {
  object_ref = {
    api_version = "apps/v1"
    kind        = "Deployment"
    namespace   = "kube-system"
    name        = "metrics-server"
  }

  wait_for = {
    condition = "Available"
    timeout   = "5m"
  }

  cluster_connection = local.cluster_connection
}

# Wait for CoreDNS (installed by cluster bootstrap)
resource "k8sconnect_wait" "coredns" {
  object_ref = {
    api_version = "apps/v1"
    kind        = "Deployment"
    namespace   = "kube-system"
    name        = "coredns"
  }

  wait_for = {
    condition = "Available"
    timeout   = "5m"
  }

  cluster_connection = local.cluster_connection
}

output "cluster_ready" {
  value = "Cluster infrastructure is ready"
  depends_on = [
    k8sconnect_wait.metrics_server,
    k8sconnect_wait.coredns
  ]
}
```
<!-- /runnable-test -->

**Use cases:**
- Wait for Helm-installed charts (cert-manager, ingress controllers, etc.)
- Wait for operator-managed resources
- Wait for resources created by kubectl or other tools
- Wait for infrastructure from other Terraform states
- Sequence your resources against existing cluster infrastructure

## Schema

### Required

- `cluster_connection` (Attributes) Kubernetes cluster connection for accessing the resource. Should match the connection used by the k8sconnect_object resource. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--cluster_connection))
- `object_ref` (Attributes) Reference to the Kubernetes object to wait for. Typically populated from k8sconnect_object.resource_name.object_ref output. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--object_ref))
- `wait_for` (Attributes) Conditions to wait for before considering the resource ready. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--wait_for))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Unique identifier for this wait operation (generated by the provider).
- `result` (Dynamic) Result of the wait operation containing extracted fields from the Kubernetes resource. The structure preserves the full path from the resource (e.g., field='spec.volumeName' → result.spec.volumeName). Follows ADR-008: 'You get only what you wait for' - only populated for field waits, null for condition/rollout waits.

<a id="nestedatt--cluster_connection"></a>
### Nested Schema for `cluster_connection`

Optional:

- `client_certificate` (String, Sensitive) Client certificate for TLS authentication. Accepts PEM format or base64-encoded PEM - automatically detected.
- `client_key` (String, Sensitive) Client certificate key for TLS authentication. Accepts PEM format or base64-encoded PEM - automatically detected.
- `cluster_ca_certificate` (String, Sensitive) Root certificate bundle for TLS authentication. Accepts PEM format or base64-encoded PEM - automatically detected.
- `context` (String) Context to use from the kubeconfig. Optional when kubeconfig contains exactly one context (that context will be used automatically). Required when kubeconfig contains multiple contexts to prevent accidental connection to the wrong cluster. Error will list available contexts if not specified when required.
- `exec` (Attributes, Sensitive) Configuration for exec-based authentication. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--cluster_connection--exec))
- `host` (String) The hostname (in form of URI) of the Kubernetes API server.
- `insecure` (Boolean) Whether server should be accessed without verifying the TLS certificate.
- `kubeconfig` (String, Sensitive) Raw kubeconfig file content.
- `proxy_url` (String) URL of the proxy to use for requests.
- `token` (String, Sensitive) Token to authenticate to the Kubernetes API server.

<a id="nestedatt--cluster_connection--exec"></a>
### Nested Schema for `cluster_connection.exec`

Required:

- `api_version` (String) API version to use when encoding the ExecCredentials resource.
- `command` (String) Command to execute.

Optional:

- `args` (List of String) Arguments to pass when executing the plugin.
- `env` (Map of String) Environment variables to set when executing the plugin.



<a id="nestedatt--object_ref"></a>
### Nested Schema for `object_ref`

Required:

- `api_version` (String) Kubernetes API version (e.g., 'v1', 'apps/v1')
- `kind` (String) Kubernetes resource kind (e.g., 'Pod', 'Deployment')
- `name` (String) Resource name

Optional:

- `namespace` (String) Resource namespace. Omit for cluster-scoped resources.


<a id="nestedatt--wait_for"></a>
### Nested Schema for `wait_for`

Optional:

- `condition` (String) Condition type that must be True. Example: 'Ready'
- `field` (String) JSONPath to field that must exist/be non-empty. Example: 'status.loadBalancer.ingress'
- `field_value` (Map of String) Map of JSONPath to expected value. Example: {'status.phase': 'Running'}
- `rollout` (Boolean) Wait for Deployment/StatefulSet/DaemonSet to complete rollout. Checks that all replicas are updated and available.
- `timeout` (String) Maximum time to wait. Defaults to 10m. Format: '30s', '5m', '1h'

## Result Output

Only **field waits** populate the `result` attribute. The result contains only the waited-for field to prevent drift from volatile or controller-managed fields.

**Example:**
```terraform
resource "k8sconnect_wait" "service" {
  object_ref = k8sconnect_object.service.object_ref

  wait_for = {
    field = "status.loadBalancer.ingress"
  }

  cluster_connection = local.cluster_connection
}

# Access the extracted field from result
output "loadbalancer_ip" {
  value = k8sconnect_wait.service.result.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip
}
```

**Other wait types** (`rollout`, `condition`, `field_value`) do NOT populate result. Use `depends_on` to sequence resources:

```terraform
resource "k8sconnect_wait" "app" {
  object_ref = k8sconnect_object.app.object_ref

  wait_for = {
    rollout = true
  }

  cluster_connection = local.cluster_connection
}

resource "k8sconnect_object" "next" {
  # ... config ...
  depends_on = [k8sconnect_wait.app]
}
```

## Timeouts

All wait operations support configurable timeouts. The default timeout is 5 minutes if not specified.

```terraform
wait_for = {
  field   = "status.loadBalancer.ingress"
  timeout = "10m"  # Options: "30s", "5m", "1h"
}
```

## JSONPath Syntax

The `field` and `field_value` attributes use **JSONPath** syntax (same as `kubectl get -o jsonpath`):

```hcl
# Simple paths
field = "status.phase"
field = "status.loadBalancer.ingress"

# Positional arrays
field = "status.conditions[0].type"
field = "status.containerStatuses[0].ready"

# JSONPath predicates (select by field value)
field = "status.conditions[?(@.type=='Ready')].status"
field_value = {
  "status.conditions[?(@.type=='Ready')].status" = "True"
}
```

**Common wait patterns:**
- LoadBalancer IP: `status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip`
- PVC volume name: `spec.volumeName`
- Job completion: `status.succeeded`
- Pod phase: `status.phase`
- Condition status: `status.conditions[?(@.type=='Ready')].status`
