# k8sconnect_manifest (Resource)

Applies a single‑document Kubernetes YAML manifest to a cluster, with per‑resource inline or kubeconfig‑based connection settings.



<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `cluster_connection` (Attributes) Cluster connection configuration for this resource. If not specified, uses the provider-level connection. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--cluster_connection))
- `yaml_body` (String) UTF‑8 encoded, single‑document Kubernetes YAML. Multi‑doc files will fail validation.

### Optional

- `delete_protection` (Boolean) Prevent accidental deletion of the resource. If set to true, the resource cannot be deleted unless this field is set to false.
- `delete_timeout` (String) How long to wait for a resource to be deleted before considering the deletion failed. Defaults to 300s (5 minutes).
- `force_conflicts` (Boolean) Force field manager conflicts during server-side apply. When false (default), operations will fail if another field manager owns the field. When true, forcibly takes ownership of conflicting fields.
- `force_destroy` (Boolean) Force deletion by removing finalizers. ⚠️ **WARNING**: Unlike other providers, this REMOVES finalizers after timeout. May cause data loss and orphaned cloud resources. See docs before using.
- `wait_for` (Attributes) Wait for resource to reach desired state during apply. Automatically enables status tracking. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--wait_for))

### Read-Only

- `field_ownership` (String) Internal tracking of field ownership by different controllers
- `id` (String) Unique identifier for this manifest (generated by the provider).
- `imported_without_annotations` (Boolean) Internal flag tracking if resource was imported without ownership annotations
- `managed_state_projection` (String) Internal field used to track managed fields for accurate drift detection.
- `status` (Dynamic) Status subresource from the live cluster state. Contains conditions, phase, and resource-specific fields like loadBalancer for Services.

Optional:

- `client_certificate` (String, Sensitive) Client certificate for TLS authentication. Accepts PEM format or base64-encoded PEM - automatically detected.
- `client_key` (String, Sensitive) Client certificate key for TLS authentication. Accepts PEM format or base64-encoded PEM - automatically detected.
- `cluster_ca_certificate` (String, Sensitive) Root certificate bundle for TLS authentication. Accepts PEM format or base64-encoded PEM - automatically detected.
- `context` (String) Context to use from the kubeconfig.
- `exec` (Attributes) Configuration for exec-based authentication. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--cluster_connection--exec))
- `host` (String) The hostname (in form of URI) of the Kubernetes API server.
- `insecure` (Boolean) Whether server should be accessed without verifying the TLS certificate.
- `kubeconfig` (String, Sensitive) Raw kubeconfig file content.
- `proxy_url` (String) URL of the proxy to use for requests.
- `token` (String, Sensitive) Token to authenticate to the Kubernetes API server.

- `command` (String) Command to execute.

Optional:

- `args` (List of String) Arguments to pass when executing the plugin.

### Nested Schema for `wait_for`

Optional:

- `condition` (String) Condition type that must be True. Example: 'Ready'
- `field` (String) JSONPath to field that must exist/be non-empty. Example: 'status.loadBalancer.ingress'
- `field_value` (Map of String) Map of JSONPath to expected value. Example: {'status.phase': 'Running'}
- `rollout` (Boolean) Wait for Deployment/StatefulSet/DaemonSet rollout. Auto-enabled for these types unless set to false.
- `timeout` (String) Maximum time to wait. Defaults to 10m. Format: '30s', '5m', '1h'
