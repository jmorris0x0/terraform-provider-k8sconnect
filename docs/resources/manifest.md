Applies a single‑document Kubernetes YAML manifest to a cluster, with per‑resource inline or kubeconfig‑based connection settings.



<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `yaml_body` (String) UTF‑8 encoded, single‑document Kubernetes YAML. Multi‑doc files will fail validation.

### Optional

- `cluster_connection` (Block, Optional) Connection settings for the target cluster. Exactly one of inline, kubeconfig_file or kubeconfig_raw must be populated. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--cluster_connection))
- `delete_protection` (Boolean) When enabled, prevents Terraform from deleting this resource. Must be disabled before destruction. Defaults to false.
- `delete_timeout` (String) Maximum time to wait for resource deletion. Defaults to '5m' for most resources, '10m' for Namespaces/PVs. Examples: '1m', '10m', '1h'. Set '0' to skip waiting (not recommended).
- `force_destroy` (Boolean) When enabled, removes finalizers to force deletion if normal deletion times out. ⚠️ WARNING: May cause data loss. Use only when you understand the implications. Defaults to false.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Unique identifier for this manifest (generated by the provider).

- `context` (String, Sensitive) Context name within the provided kubeconfig (file or raw).
- `exec` (Object, Sensitive) Inline exec‑auth configuration for dynamic credentials. Must include api_version and command; args is optional. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--cluster_connection--exec))
- `host` (String, Sensitive) Kubernetes API server endpoint (e.g. https://example.com). Required for inline mode.
- `kubeconfig_file` (String, Sensitive) Filesystem path to an existing kubeconfig file. Always supports live diffing.
- `kubeconfig_raw` (String, Sensitive) Raw kubeconfig YAML content (CI‑friendly).
