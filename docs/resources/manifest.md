<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `yaml_body` (String) UTF‑8 encoded, single‑document Kubernetes YAML. Multi‑doc files will fail validation.

### Optional

- `cluster_connection` (Attributes) Cluster connection configuration for this resource. If not specified, uses the provider-level connection. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--cluster_connection))
- `delete_protection` (Boolean) Prevent accidental deletion of the resource. If set to true, the resource cannot be deleted unless this field is set to false.
- `delete_timeout` (String) How long to wait for a resource to be deleted before considering the deletion failed. Defaults to 300s (5 minutes).
- `force_conflicts` (Boolean) Force ownership of fields even when conflicting with other field managers. Default is false, which warns but doesn't override other controllers.
- `force_destroy` (Boolean) Force destroy resources that have finalizers and are stuck in 'Terminating' state. This removes finalizers before deletion.

### Read-Only

- `field_ownership` (String) Internal tracking of field ownership by different controllers
- `id` (String) Unique identifier for this manifest (generated by the provider).
- `imported_without_annotations` (Boolean) Internal flag tracking if resource was imported without ownership annotations
- `managed_state_projection` (String) Internal field used to track managed fields for accurate drift detection.
